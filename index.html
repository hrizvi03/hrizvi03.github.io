                <h3>My Software Engineering Journey</h3>
                <p>I am a fourth-year undergraduate student studying Software Engineering at Loyola University Chicago.
                    As a student studying for a career in Software Engineering, I was prompted to consider the moral
                    impact of my work on society. While professions such as those in medicine and law have a more direct
                    association with helping individuals or addressing injustices, the role of a Software Engineer may
                    seem less necessary and useful in its societal contribution. I found myself at crossroads at Loyola,
                    contemplating whether my passion for coding could truly make a difference in the world around me --
                    until I realized the transformative power of technology in my parents' lives. As they immigrated
                    here alone, leaving their families in their homeland, they would not have guessed that they’d be
                    able to see their faces and video call them whenever, and at a reasonable cost. They didn’t realize
                    how easy it’d be to understand directions in this foreign country with phone maps or connect online
                    with other Shia Muslims that also immigrated here. Technology made it easier for my sisters and I to
                    prosper in America and land at four-year universities, as we had resources such as online tutors and
                    programs. Our lives are changing day-by-day with new technology, and by taking on a career in the
                    field, I would love to contribute to these world-changing experiences. The widespread accessibility
                    to information and the connection enabled by technology shows the indirect yet great influence of
                    Software Engineering on society.

                    <p>I led the design of a secure and scalable website for a nonprofit telehealth platform, enabling
                        the delivery of free medical services to underserved communities in Iraq and Pakistan. I advised
                        on and implemented a robust patient intake system that ensured seamless data capture, easy
                        access, and compliance with local privacy regulations. In addition, I provided ongoing training
                        and technical support to staff and healthcare providers, ensuring smooth integration and
                        effective use of telehealth tools in low-resource environments. I also continuously monitored
                        and optimized system performance, ensuring high availability and minimal downtime, particularly
                        in remote or unstable regions.

                    <p>Last August, I represented Gen-Z students entering the workforce at Handshake's second Talent Lab
                        panel,
                        where eight leaders discussed talent acquisition and early talent recruiting. I shared insights
                        on hybrid
                        work, mentorship, and professional development. Discussions also covered AI's role in humanizing
                        job searches
                        and strategies for quantifying ROI in talent acquisition.</p>

                    <p>In November 2024, I contributed to a Business Insider article examining challenges Gen Z college
                        graduates face
                        entering the workforce. The article highlighted a Handshake survey showing over half of the
                        class of 2025 feels
                        pessimistic about job prospects due to layoffs, student loan debt, and AI concerns. It explores
                        competition for
                        entry-level roles and changes in early career opportunities.</p>
